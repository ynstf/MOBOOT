Moboot is a chatbot developed in Moroccan Darija, and it is considered the first of its kind. Its name "Moboot" was chosen to align with Moroccan culture, as the name Mohammed is popular in this country and holds significant cultural connotations and dimensions.

Based on a collection of Moroccan phrases and responses, Moboot has been trained to engage in relatively short conversations with users.

Moboot is currently in the development stage and does not yet possess sufficient data to be fully functional. It is available to anyone in the technical and information field for further development or to obtain some information that may be beneficial for personal projects.

The model has been trained and made available online thanks to the Flask framework, responsible for its API.
